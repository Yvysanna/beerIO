# BeerBuddy

This GitHub Repository contains all code for the merging, processing and wrangling of data. It also contains the training of a machine learn algorithm and prediction of data through machine learning. It is part of a group project for the organization of beer information.


This project aims to organize a great collection of beer information (such as beer name, style, the brewery that brewed it, and information about its flavors). The prediction of beer colors based on flavor attributes has been approached.

All code in this repository has been written by Yvette Rosanna Schr√∂der (GitHub user (Yvysanna)['https://github.com/Yvysanna']). The code is part of a group project for the course Information Organization at the University of Amsterdam.
